# 2048-js
Website for playing 2048

This game is hosted at : https://bjornamr.github.io/2048-js/

To play you have to hit the key "s" for start. 
It auto generates colours for the different numbers from the start. This means that for every new start a number will have a new number


It is not a full game and has minor things that would have to be fixed for it to be done. Like game over and score. 
I made this as a side project for fun to show people in a course i held in web development. 

The target group was secondary school and high school.
